# Two-Sample Tests of High-Dimensional Means for Compositional Data

In this repo, we consider a two-sample testing problem for high-dimensional compositional data and formulate a testable hypothesis of compositional equivalence for the means of
two latent log-basis vectors. We propose a test through the centered log-ratio transformation of
the compositions. The asymptotic null distribution of the test statistic is derived and its power
against sparse alternatives is investigated. A modified test for paired samples is also considered.
